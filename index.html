        <h3>What is the KaKaoTalk?</h3>
      </li>
      KakaoTalk (Hangul: 카카오톡), or sometimes KaTalk, is a free mobile instant messaging application for smartphones
      with free text and free call features, operated by Kakao Corporation

        <h3>KaKaoTalk's history</h3>
      </li>
      It was launched on March 18, 2010 and is currently available on iOS, Android, Bada OS, BlackBerry, Windows Phone,
      Nokia Asha, Windows and macOS.
      As of May 2017, KakaoTalk had 220 million registered and 49 million monthly active users.

        <h3>KaKaoTalk's problem</h3>
      </li>
      Kakao does not store any of the user's chats over an extended period of time, so users often have the problem of
      losing the chat history when switching to a new device. While Kakao claims to provide a cloud backup feature to
      address this issue, this service has limitations as it does not back up open chats or longer messages, and backup
      file size is limited to 20.0 MB.
